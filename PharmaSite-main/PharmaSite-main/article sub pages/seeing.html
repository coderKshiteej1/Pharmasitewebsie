What is conjunctivitis?</b>
</br>
Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is an infection that affects the conjunctiva, which is the clear layer that surrounds your eyelids and covers the white part of your eye. During infection, the small blood vessels in this layer get inflamed and stand out more. That's why the whites of your eyes may look reddish or pink, and that's how it got its name - pink eye!  </br></br>

Most cases of conjunctivitis are caused by the same viruses as the common cold. It can also happen for other reasons, such as bacterial infections, chemical irritants, traditional eye remedies, or allergies. Sometimes, exposure to toxins and local irritants can also lead to non-infectious conjunctivitis.
