    <img  src="https://res.fkhealthplus.com/incom/healtharticle/images/1690973660_body016.jpg"class=" m-4 " >
    With an alarming rise in heart attacks among youngsters, research now suggests that we, as Indians also have the highest risk of getting a heart attack.
    </br>
    Heart disease can affect anyone, regardless of age or family history. In this eye-opening interview, we sit down with Dr. Dimpu Edwin (MD, DM Cardiology), an eminent cardiologist, to address the burning questions surrounding heart disease.
  </br>
    Dr. Dimpu, tells us how our lifestyle and eating habits put us at risk, and how we can take proactive measures to reduce our risk.
    
  </br> </br>
    
   <b> 1. What are the most common heart diseases seen in India?</b>
  </br>
    Heart diseases primarily fall under two categories-Heart attack (coronary artery disease) and heart failure. In urban cities, heart attacks are more commonly seen, closely followed by heart failure. Other heart diseases like valvular heart disease, arrhythmia, and congenital heart disease are also seen, but they are less common.
    
  </br>
</br>
    
    <b> 2. Who has a greater chance of developing heart disease?</b>
    </br>
    As we grow older, especially after 40, the chances of developing heart disease increase. Men tend to be more vulnerable than women. But there's more to the story.
  </br>
    Conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes can raise the risk even higher. And our lifestyle choices matter too. Being inactive and indulging in unhealthy, packaged foods can make matters worse. And work stress? That's like adding fuel to the fire.
  </br>
    There's a family element too. If heart disease runs in your family, you may be at a higher risk. And we can't forget about tobacco. Smoking or being around second-hand smoke is a big no-no. And if you're a smoker, quitting smoking can turn the tables.
    
  </br> </br>
    
  <b>  3. What are the early signs of heart disease, and when should people seek medical attention? </b></br> </br>
  </br>
    Everyone over the age of 20 should start getting screened for high blood pressure (hypertension) and cholesterol, every 3-5 years.[2] Once you hit 40, you should start yearly screenings for heart disease. [3]
  </br>
    Heart disease can creep up anytime with the following sneaky signs.
    
    If you have chest pain during activity or when you're climbing stairs, it's like a warning signal. If you feel unusually worn out or tired even without doing much, it's your body sending an SOS.
  </br>
    A temporary blackout or sudden loss of consciousness shouldn't be ignored. And if you find yourself sweating a lot or gasping for air, this is your body sending an urgent message. These symptoms won't go away, even after resting.
    
    So, if you experience any of these symptoms, don't hesitate and seek medical attention immediately.
    
  </br> </br>
    
   <b>4. Why are heart attacks in young becoming so common nowadays?</b>
  </br> </br>
    Heart attacks are striking the young these days due to this paradigm shift in our lifestyles and in heart diseases.
  </br>
    Stress is no joke. Data suggests that youngsters (35-40 years) working in a stressful job, who do not have blood pressure or diabetes, - but the impact of stress on their heart - is equal to someone battling high blood pressure and diabetes for a solid five to six years.
    
    But here's another twist in the tale. Young hearts often face attacks during or just after intense exercise or a heated argument when sudden excursions in blood pressure occur. So, raising your blood pressure is not worth the risk, and keeping your cool becomes key.
    
  </br> </br>
    
  <b> 5. How is heart disease related to my diet?</b>
  </br> </br>
    Here's a question that pops up time and again. It's also a favorite among my patients.
  </br>
    There's no secret mantra to eating healthy, but it all boils down to a healthy lifestyle and staying active. You might have heard about LDL, the so-called "bad" cholesterol, making headlines. But guess what? After countless studies, we still can't say for sure if bad cholesterol alone causes heart attacks.
  </br>
    In fact, studies in India have revealed something fascinating. Youngsters under 35 who had heart attacks didn't have high bad cholesterol levels. Instead, their triglycerides were up, and their good cholesterol (HDL) levels were down. And guess what fuels those triglycerides? Carbohydrates!
  </br>
    It's not all carbs that are the culprits. It's the refined ones, like sugary treats and refined flour (maida). Swap them for whole carbs, like whole wheat (atta), which have a gentler impact on your blood sugar. Another fact is that we can't prevent high blood pressure by avoiding all salt because our bodies need it. What we should steer clear of instead is added salt in our diets. The key is to make your breakfast the star of the show, giving you around 50% of your daily calories, 30% comes from lunch, while dinner gracefully fills the remaining 20%.
  </br>
    So, let's not go overboard with diet fads. Instead, let's focus on staying physically active and enjoying a normal diet.
    
  </br> </br>
    
  <b>  6. How to prevent heart disease?</b>  </br> </br>
    
    First things first, find that sweet work-life balance. It's like a secret potion that helps reduce stress. And let's not forget about exercise. Just 20 minutes a day can do wonders but don't overdo it. Find your rhythm and stay within your limits.
  </br>
    Now, let's talk about food. Say goodbye to unhealthy choices and embrace a balanced diet. Your heart will thank you for choosing healthy nourishing meals. Oh, and if you're a smoker, it's time to quit.
  </br>
    Quality sleep is another factor. Did you know that if your sleep gets interrupted (obstructive sleep apnea), it can raise your blood pressure? So, prioritize good sleep, it's like a rejuvenating gift to your heart.
  </br>
    And if you have high blood pressure or diabetes, keep a watchful eye. Regularly monitor your blood pressure and blood sugar levels. This keeps heart disease in check, making sure everything stays on track.
    
  </br> </br>
    
  
  
  
  <b> When should I get tested for heart disease?</b>  </br></br>

    
    If you're 40 or older, it's time for a check-up. Indians, with their genetic makeup, have a higher risk of heart disease. So, get yourself screened with a complete cardiac test including ECG (electrocardiogram) and ECHO.
    
    Even if you're younger than 40, consider testing if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease, or if your close relatives have suffered from heart conditions.
    
  </br> </br>
    
<b> 8. What should I do if I suspect a heart attack?</b> </br> </br>
    
    If you suspect a heart attack, act fast! Call a loved one and head straight to the nearest hospital. Time is crucial when it comes to saving your heart.
  </br>
    Heart attack symptoms can be mistaken for heartburn, but if you have persistent stomach pain, not relieved by antacids and lasting over an hour, accompanied by sweating or breathlessness, it's likely a heart attack. Don't ignore it, rush and get an ECG done.
  </br>
    Even without chest pain, get an ECG if you experience left-hand pain, upper-body pain, or back or shoulder pain. If you suddenly feel dizzy or lose consciousness, call for help immediately.
    
    And remember, learning CPR is a responsibility we all share—it can be lifesaving in emergencies!"
