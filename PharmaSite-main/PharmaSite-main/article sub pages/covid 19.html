    In the last few days, India has seen a staggering rise in COVID-19 cases, with over 23,000 new cases being reported on 20th July, 2022. This is creating speculations around a fourth wave of coronavirus infection  as COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease.

  <span class="text-primary"> As cases of Monkeypox, another contagious viral disease rise in India, should you be worried? Read to know more.</span>
</br> </br>
    When a person infected with coronavirus speaks, coughs, sneezes, or laughs, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air and land on surfaces. A healthy person within 2 meters who inhales these droplets is more likely to contract COVID-19. Touching a contaminated surface before touching his mouth, nose, or eyes may also spread the disease, but the risk is minimal. 
    </br> </br>
     
    
    Because Covid spreads in closed spaces with little ventilation, AC offices with more working employees might aggravate the spread. (2) If you are returning to office or have returned to work, here are some practical ways to stay safe from COVID-19, post pandemic:

</br>
    
    Safety guidelines in the workplace:
    
    Follow respiratory hygiene and wear a mask: When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or handkerchief. You can also use a disposable tissue and throw it in a covered bin. 
</br>
    Interacting with coworkers in the office increases the risk of contracting Covid. A mask acts as a barrier to the transmission of corona. Wear masks, both inside the office and outside, especially while taking crowded public transportation to work. 
</br>
    WHO advises to wear a mask which fits well and completely covers the mouth and nose. A 3 layered, disposable medical mask, a surgical/N95 mask or respirator or even a multilayered homemade mask can be worn inside the office premises. (4)
    
     
</br> </br>
    Maintain a social distance: Avoid touching, shaking hands or hugging coworkers. Within the working area, keep a 6-foot safe distance while sitting or standing with colleagues. Seating arrangements can be changed as needed. 
    
    To avoid close contact, prefer virtual meetings over face-to-face gatherings. Avoid organizing team outings and social get togethers.
    
    Covid transmission is possible in canteens and cafeterias. Bring your own lunch to work, drink tea or coffee from disposable cups and avoid sharing personal items.
