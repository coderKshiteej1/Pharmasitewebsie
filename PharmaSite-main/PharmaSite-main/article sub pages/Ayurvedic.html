This diet excludes processed, spicy, and deep-fried foods, promoting easy digestion. It promotes mindful eating and fixed meal times. Sattvic foods strengthen, purify and improve your health and longevity.

  <b>2. HERBAL REMEDIES </b>
    
     
</br> </br>
<b>  Ginger:</b>
    Ginger, well-known for its ability to relieve stomach discomfort, promotes digestion by increasing food movement in the GI tract and protecting the gut. It may prevent you from heartburn by maintaining the stomach lining and reducing acid reflux. Ginger's natural laxative properties aid in bowel movement and the treatment of constipation. Furthermore, ginger relieves bloating and gas while supporting a healthy gut. You can eat either ginger slices or squeeze a lemon into a cup of hot water combined with it.
    
</br> </br>
    
  <b>  Curd:</b>
    As per Ayurveda, Curd is an effective remedy for digestive problems due to its numerous advantages. It is rich in probiotics, promotes gut health, helps with indigestion, and boosts metabolism. Its energy-rich carbs provide a quick energy source. Buttermilk from curd cures constipation by promoting intestinal activity and eliminating toxins.
    
     
</br> </br>
<b>  Triphala:</b>
    Triphala, a mixture of Amla, Haritaki, and Bibhitaki, provides a variety of health advantages due to its rich ingredients. Amla, rich in vitamin C, aids digestion and boosts immunity. Haritaki is renowned as the "King of Medicines" because of its metabolic and anti-inflammatory properties. Bibhitaki supports your gut health and digestion. Triphala improves digestion and metabolism, relieves constipation, and promotes bowel regularity. It's also effective against hyperacidity and bloating. Triphala might be a good choice for you to maintain a healthy gut and manage numerous digestive issues. 
    
     
</br> </br>
<b>  Asafoetida:</b>
    Asafoetida (Hing) offers various benefits for digestion and stomach health. It enhances digestion by increasing digestive enzymes and bile production. Its natural anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties protect against stomach infections. Hing's alkaline nature reduces acid reflux and acidity; With its fiber content, Hing prevents constipation in adults and children. You can add it to warm water or curries.
    
     
</br> </br>
<b> Isapgol:</b>
    Isabgol, also known as psyllium husk, is a natural remedy that can help with various digestive issues. For people who struggle with constipation and end up having piles, Isabgol can be quite helpful. It has a special property that soaks up water and makes your stool softer and easier to pass. This can reduce the bleeding, pain, and stretching that can happen with piles. Isabgol also supports digestion by forming a protective layer in your stomach and intestines, which can help with acidity and proper digestion. It's like a friend to your gut because it has a substance that good bacteria like to eat, making your gut stronger and your immune system healthier. 
    
</br> </br>
    
<b>  Cumin - Coriander - Fennel Tea:</b>
    Cumin, coriander, and fennel tea offer numerous benefits for you. The tea is renowned in Ayurveda for its ability to flush toxins, improve digestion, and address issues like gas, bloating, and indigestion. Cumin stimulates digestion, coriander improves digestion and treats intestinal disorders, while fennel boosts metabolism, stops cramping, and aids fat burning. The combination of these herbs creates a powerful tonic for digestive wellness. To prepare, boil cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds in water, strain, and sip throughout the day.
